# Test_repo
Its a test repository that if i would ever want to do something new i mightt need to test it first before using. 

I know, i know that testing is more of a devops thing. 
But this is more of a discovery part.
whicch kinda means that if i ever want to do things new in a way where i want to upgrade my self,
I would literally test it out.

As an example is that i would like to use Software annd DataScience together.
So I thought of usinng backend frameworks for computations and frontend for Design.
which that is my first app in this repository.
It means Im combining these because i want to do more and test more whille making myself productive.
