i justt wanna test it out if things would be good.

Well to maake the HTML,frontend html templating with templlatting or frontend Dynamic of this.
You might need to use 2 fetchin of data in  the DOM.
1.fetch response.json().question
2.fetch response.json().answer

well why not use the response.body?

response.body is used more on large files while response.json is used more on small files.

Use /power url with port other than the backend port.

This is a note for people who want to use fullstack oor templating engines.

I didnt post the html of this because i want to focus more on request and response.

I just want to try it. I didnt try it before because Go has tons of special syntax which is different from C andd C++.
like the walrus ":="
