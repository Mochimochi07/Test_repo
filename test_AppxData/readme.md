i justt wanna test it out if things would be good.

Well to maake the HTML,frontend html templating with templlatting or frontend Dynamic of this.
You might need to use 2 fetchin of data.
1.fetch response.json().question
2.fetch response.json().answer

well why not use the response.body?
response.body is used more on large files while response.json is used more on small files.

Use /power url with port other than the backend port.

This is a note for people who want to use fullstack oor templating engines.
